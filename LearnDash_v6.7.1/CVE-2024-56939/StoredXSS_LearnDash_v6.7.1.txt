CVE-2024-56939 LearnDash v6.7.1 is affected by Stored XSS in materials-content and ld-comment-body classes.

Description
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Stored XSS) occurs when an application stores malicious scripts in its database or other persistent storage mechanisms. These scripts are then served to other users when they interact with the application. This type of XSS is particularly dangerous because the malicious payload resides on the server and can impact multiple users without requiring additional attacker interaction.
•	Stored XSS is commonly found in features like:
	o	User comments or reviews
	o	User profiles or posts
	o	Message boards or forums
	o	Content management systems (CMS)
•	When a victim visits a page containing the stored script, their browser executes it, allowing attackers to:
	o	Steal sensitive user data (e.g., cookies, session tokens).
	o	Perform actions on behalf of the user (e.g., creating an admin account, making courses available to the public, transferring funds).
	o	Redirect users to malicious websites.
	o	Execute other forms of social engineering.
	
Recommendations
•	Input Validation
	o	Ensure all user input is validated against a strict whitelist of acceptable values. Disallow any unexpected or potentially harmful input.
	o	Reject suspicious characters such as <, >, " \', and &, unless explicitly required.
•	Output Encoding
	o	Apply proper encoding before displaying user-supplied data in the browser:
			HTML Encoding: Convert < to &lt;, > to &gt;, etc.
			JavaScript Encoding: Use libraries like OWASP's Java Encoder to safely include data in JavaScript contexts.
			CSS Encoding: Encode data before embedding it into style tags or attributes.
			URL Encoding: Encode data used in URLs or query parameters.
•	Content Security Policy (CSP)
	o	Implement a strict Content Security Policy to control which scripts can execute in the browser.
