Reflected XSS
=============

Vendor: Zeta Global

Product: Zeta Marketing Platform (ZMP) v1.0

Role of rfihub.com: Facilitates programmatic advertising through third-party cookies, enabling personalized marketing and tracking.



Description
The "ca" GET parameter on "p.rfihub.com" is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). User-supplied input passed through this parameter is returned by the server without proper validation or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JS code into the response. When a victim clicks a crafted URL containing a payload in the "ca" parameter, the injected script executes in the context of the victimâ€™s browser, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data exposure. This vulnerability arises from insufficient input sanitization and improper output handling.



Impacts
Session Hijacking: Attackers can steal cookies or session tokens, compromising user accounts.
Phishing: Users can be tricked into submitting sensitive data to attacker-controlled endpoints.
Defacement: Injected scripts can alter page content or display unwanted messages.
Malware Delivery: Scripts can redirect users to malicious downloads or exploits.




Recommendations
Input Validation: Restrict the "ca" parameter to expected values.
Sanitization: Use a HTML/JS sanitizer.
Output Encoding: Apply context-aware HTML encoding before displaying user input.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Restrict execution of untrusted scripts.
